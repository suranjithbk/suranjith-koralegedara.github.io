# Applied Analytics & Data Science Projects

Below are example applied projects that show my transition from research to business-relevant analytics.

## Route optimization for climate-resilient logistics (demo)
**Goal:** Demonstrate integrating hazard maps into delivery route optimization.  
**Tools:** Python, OR-Tools, QGIS, PostGIS (demo code in linked repo).  
**Outcome:** Example routes and cost trade-offs under hazard scenarios.

## Time-series forecasting of seasonal demand / environmental signals
**Goal:** Apply ARIMA/VAR models to forecast seasonal signals (e.g., rainfall or energy output).  
**Tools:** Python (statsmodels), R (forecast), model evaluation scripts.

## Customer / stakeholder segmentation (demo)
**Goal:** Clustering to segment stakeholders for targeted engagement (KMeans, hierarchical).  
**Tools:** scikit-learn, PCA, silhouette diagnostics.
