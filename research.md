# Research Highlights

## Springtime Soil Moisture Variability — CMIP6 MME (2025)
**Summary:** Multi-model ensemble analysis of soil moisture drivers across Southeast China and Taiwan, focusing on spring (MAM) drought variability and projected changes.  
**Methods:** CMIP6 MME, standardized anomalies, Random Forest & multiple linear regression for driver attribution.  
**Status:** Under peer review.

## Seasonal & Interannual Diurnal Rainfall — Sri Lanka (2022–2024)
**Summary:** Observational and reanalysis study on diurnal rainfall cycles and modulation by ENSO and the MJO.  
**Methods:** IMERG evaluation, station analysis, composite/regression methods.

## Mesoscale Modeling of Extreme Rainfall (WRF)
**Summary:** High-resolution dynamical modeling of extreme rainfall events in Sri Lanka — process-level analysis of mesoscale convective systems and flood risk.
